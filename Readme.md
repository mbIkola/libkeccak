# Keccak hashing function  `5*5*64bit`(1600 bit)/24rounds  variant implementation

_Also known as `SHA3`._ 

# Purpose #
static library which would be used for further iterative modifications/optimizations and cross-compiled to few other non-standard platforms, like 'browser's asm.js (see emscripten folder in project root)

# howto
Dunno. `cmake .` and `make ` should work for you. CLion should autogenerate build targets if you import project from source.
